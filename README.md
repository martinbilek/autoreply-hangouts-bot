# Introduction

`autoreply-hangouts-bot` is a simple Google Hangouts chatbot designed to auto-reply all incoming messages.

My motivation to create such chatbot is that I'm trying to leave Google Hangouts and I fear that I would miss some (maybe important) messages from colleagues or friends.

So I created tool to automaticaly inform them whenewer they write me a message.
