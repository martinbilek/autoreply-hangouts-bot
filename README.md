# Introduction

"autoreply-hangouts-bot" is a very simple Hangouts chat bot designed to auto-reply all incoming messages.

Main reason to made such app is, that I'm trying to leave Hangouts.
Because I used Hangouts for last couple of years, I would miss some (maybe important) messages from
collegues or friends. So I wanted to inform them via autoreply message, that I'm not using Hangouts anymore.
